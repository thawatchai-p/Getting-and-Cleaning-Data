## Files
**CodeBook.md** is a code book that describes the variables, data cleaning, and transformation in order to tidy up the data.

**run_analysis.R** is a file that has already performed the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps instruction required as described in the course project:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**TidyData.txt** is a exported data after tidy up in according to the project instructions described above.
